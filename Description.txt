During my last 3 years of experience, I have been the lead data scientist and supervisor of 3 projects. Two related to health care and one related to the mining industry. They all have in common the use of data-driven models to create predictions of practical use. My duties include.
- Training my colleagues on Machine Learning.
- Experiment design.
- Implementation.
- Communicate results.







Describe a specific business problem you solved applying advanced data science methodology (i.e., machine learning or advanced statistics):

Mineral Exploration: I developed a data-driven artificial intelligence model capable of predicting the concentration of minerals on the Earth's surface at a given geographical location. I use a database that compiles the information provided by mining companies during the last years of exploration. The data comprises tabulated information about the collected bedrock samples containing sample coordinates, chemical analysis results, and lithology. I also have a similar dataset consisting of sediment samples and a high-resolution magnetic field map of Qu√©bec.

Nexus BCI: This work has resulted from the joint effort of a multidisciplinary group of specialists in Artificial Intelligence, mechanics, and medicine. The result is a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) that allows controlling video games through electroencephalography (EEG) signals generated by human thoughts and acquired through a headset equipped with EEG electrodes. The generated signals are produced when the user executes imaginary legs, arms, and tongue movements. Machine learning models classify those signals that translate into commands to control multiple video games. This tool has potential applications in the treatment and rehabilitation of stroke patients for the recovery of lost motor and cognitive abilities.

Health Mobile App: This project aims to model the existence or appearance of medical conditions in patients based on their clinical history, which consists of measurements of their vital signs and other data clinicians collect. To build these data-driven models, a database of patients suffering from some cardiac disease and who underwent a catheterization procedure is used. Nine medical conditions are defined as target variables and three modelling problems are considered: Predict an existing medical condition from the patient's present state of vital signs, predict an existing medical condition from the patient's clinical history, and predict the time it takes for the patient in developing a medical condition from their clinical history. The results show that these three problems can be modelled from the available data with different effectiveness for each target variable under consideration.





Describe a past training that you provided to either subordinates, colleagues or senior leaders. What was the training and what methodology did you use?

Training my colleagues is a daily part of my job, and I enjoy it the most because of my teaching vocation. Most of my colleagues are co-ops and have little knowledge of Machine Learning, so the challenge is teaching them the minimum necessary to start working on the projects quickly. Some handwritten slides from the training sessions I teach for my colleagues can be found on my website.
