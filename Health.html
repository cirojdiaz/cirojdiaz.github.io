												<h2>Predict heart disease risk from a history of vital signs</h2>
											</header>

											</a>
											<p>This project aims to model the existence or appearance of medical conditions in
												patients based on their clinical history, which consists of measurements of
												their vital signs and other data collected by clinicians. To build these
												data-driven models, a database of patients suffering from some cardiac disease
												and who underwent a catheterization procedure is used. Nine medical conditions
												are defined as target variables, and three modeling problems are considered:
												Predict an existing medical condition from the patient's present state of vital
												signs, predict an existing medical condition from the patient's clinical history,
												and predict the time it takes for the patient in developing a medical condition
												from their clinical history. The results show that these three problems can be modeled
												from the available data with different effectiveness for each target variable under
												consideration.</p>
											<p>For this project, I used a dataset containing data of anonymized individuals.
												The nine targets in the following table are used to test and develop the models that must
												predict the probability of developing the defined conditions. </p>

													<p style="font-size: 12px;">*Variables/targets that entail the maximum stenosis (LADST, LCXST, LMST, PRXLADST, RCAST)
														of specific arteries are categorized as a ‘medical condition’ if the percentage of stenosis is 70% or above.
														Conversely, if the percentage of stenosis is below 70%, it is categorized as ‘no medical condition.’<br>
														**Variable is measured through several disease vessels (e.g., 0, 1, 2, 3). If the value is 0, the
														patient is categorized as ‘no medical condition’. If the value is 1-3, the patient is
														categorized as a ‘medical condition’.<br>
													***If the value is 0, the patient is categorized as ‘no medical condition’.

											<p>Let’s look at the vital signs in the data; these are to be used as some of the basic features the
												model uses to make predictions. Table 2 compiles them with names and descriptions. </p>

											<p>Several classic classifiers from Scikit-learn Python's libraries are used. These are MLPClassifier (ANN), Logistic Regresion (LR),
												Support Vector Machines Clasifier (SVM), Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier (SGD), Gaussian Process Classifier (GPC),
												Decision Tree Classifier (DT), Random Forest (RF). And from dmlc XGBoost (XGB) Python’s library, the XGBoost classifier
												is also used. </p>

											<p>We also constructed a network that comprises seven layers. Each layer consists of a fully connected layer,
												batch normalization, and dropout. The fully connected layers perform linear transformations
												on the input data, with the output size progressively decreasing from 1024 in the first layer
												to 1 in the final layer. Batch normalization is applied to the output of each fully connected layer,
												normalizing it to enhance the model’s speed, performance, and stability. Dropout is also incorporated, r
												andomly nullifying a fraction of input units during training to mitigate overfitting. The activation
												function across all layers is the Leaky ReLU, which allows a slight gradient when the unit is inactive,
												thereby addressing the dying ReLU problem. The final output of the model, which is the output of the
												seventh fully connected layer, can be utilized for tasks such as regression or classification, depending on the problem.

											<p>We must begin by defining what we are trying to measure, which translated into machine learning language would be:
												what metrics do we want to use to quantify the goodness of the predictions? This question intersects
												with the field of clinical medicine because we need to know the practical implications of errors.
												To avoid not pleasing someone, we simply calculate the most common
												metrics for classification problems: balanced accuracy, and recall.
											Next to tables contain the results for Classical models</p>

										<p>The best values of each metric are listed along with the respective model that produces it in the next Teble.
											Those listed with two models had the same value. Followed by the best model according to each metric.</p>

										</section>

										<p> We can generate several comments from Table above. The first is that the variables Death, CHFSEV, and NUMDZV
											are easy to predict by almost all models. Random Forest is the indisputable best model to predict
											LCXST and RCAST conditions, retrieving the highest values for all the 3 metrics.
											It would be a good choice for ACV and LADST if Precision or Recall are prioritized, although
											ANN and SVM produce higher values of Balanced Accuracy. Something similar happens for LMST and PRXLADST,
											where XGBoost dominates for PRecision and Recall while SVM dominates for balanced accuracy.
